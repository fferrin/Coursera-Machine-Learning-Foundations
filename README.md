Machine Learning Foundations
===============================

Code for programming assignments in Python from the Coursera's course Machine
Learning Foundations, taught by Carlos Guestrin and Emily Fox both of them from Washington University.

Week 1 - Introduction (No assignment)
-------------------------------------
 - **getting-started-with-iPython-Notebook.ipynb** - Introduction to iPython
 notebook.
 - **getting-started-with-SFrames.ipynb** - Introduction to SFrame.
 - **people-example.csv** - Input data for week 1.

Week 2 - Regression: Predicting House Prices (100%)
---------------------------------------------------
 - **predicting-house-prices.ipynb** - iPython notebook with a regression model
 developed for prediction of house prices.
 - **home_data.gl** - Database containing information about houses in the US 
 (size, number of bathrooms, number of rooms, and so on) that was used to 
 develop the aforementioned regression model.

Week 3 - Classification: Analyzing Product Sentiment (100%)
----------------------------------------------------------
 - **analyzing-product-sentiment.ipynb** - iPython notebook with a 
 classification model developed for recommending products on Amazon.
 - **amazon_baby.gl** - Amazon database containing nformation about products 
 ratings and reviews hat was used to develop the aforementioned classification 
 model. 

Week 4 - Clustering and Similarity: Document Retrieval (100%)
-------------------------------------------------------------
 - **document-retrieval.ipynb** - iPython notebook with a clustering model 
 developed to find people releated to a given input.
 - **people_wiki.gl** - Wikipedia database containing articles about famous 
 people. 

Week 5 - Recomending Products: Song Recommender (100%)
------------------------------------------------------
 - **song-recommender.ipynb** - iPython notebook with a recommender model 
 developed to find similar songs or recommend songs to a given user.
 - **song_data.gl** - Database containing information about musical preferences 
 of users.

Week 6 - Deep Learning: Deep Features for Image Classification and Retrieval (100%)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - **deep-features-for-image-classification.ipynb** - iPython notebook with a
 neural network trained to find similar images and clasify them in into one of 
 four categories. Moreover, use transfer learning from the neural network 
 ImageNet to compare perfomance against a neural network trained with millions of
 images.
 - **deep-features-for-image-retrieval.ipynb** - iPython notebook with a neural
 network developed to find similar images in the dataset.
 - **image_test_data.gl** - Folder with database for traininput data for week 2.
 - **image_train_data.gl** - Folder with input data for week 2.
